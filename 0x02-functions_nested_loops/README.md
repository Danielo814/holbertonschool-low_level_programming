Project 0x02. C - functions, nested loops.

This project was designed to teach me what exactly a function is and why it is important to declare a function's return type and parameters depending on what I am trying to accomplish. Also, it taught me why function prototypes are important when we need to specify certain return types and parameters for those functions to be called by ohther functions.
